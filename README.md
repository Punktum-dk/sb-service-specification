## Features

<a id="authorise-change-name-servers"></a>

### Authorise Change Name Servers

1. Log in to the self-service portal [:eye_speech_bubble:](screenshots/SB-login-en.png)
1. Find the domain name in the list of domain names you want to work on [:eye_speech_bubble:](screenshots/SB-filter-en.png)
1. Click on the domain name to go to the detailed overview
1. On the detail page, locate the section "Authorisations codes" on the right side of the page [:eye_speech_bubble:](screenshots/SB-details-en.png)
1. Click "Change Name Servers" to go to the page to generate the authorisation code [:eye_speech_bubble:](screenshots/SB-change-ns-generate-en.png)
1. Click "GENERATE CODE"

A code is now generated, this code should be provided to the registrar or name server administrator to whom the user wants to use for name service. [:eye_speech_bubble:](screenshots/SB-change-ns-generated-en.png)

Once the code is in the possession of the registrar, it can be used to execute the actual.

The authorisation code works:

- Only for a single domain name
- Only for a single operation
- Has a lifespan of 14 days
- Can be replaced with a new code
- Can be deleted, meaning the authorisation is retracted

An authorization token can be generated/issued for change of name servers by another name server administrator, where the receiving name server administrator via the token has the authorization to perform the operation.

The authorization token has to be communicated out of band.

The token has the format: `<role>-<operation>-<unique token>`

An example: `NSA-REDEL-098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6`

- The authorization is generated/issued by a registrar (`NSA`, for name server administrator)
- The authorization is for a transfer operation (`REDEL`, for redelegation)
- and finally a unique key

Since an authorization could also be issue by the registrant or proxy, those example would resemble the following:

As registrant: `OWN-REDEL-098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6`

- The authorization is generated/issued by a registrant (`OWN`, for registrant/_owner_)
- The authorization is for a transfer operation (`REDEL`)
- and finally a unique key

As proxy `PXY-REDEL-098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6`

- The authorization is generated/issued by a registrant (`PXY`, for proxy)
- The authorization is for a transfer operation (`REDEL`)
- and finally a unique key

### Authorise Change Registrar

1. Log in to the self-service portal [:eye_speech_bubble:](screenshots/SB-login-en.png)
1. Find the domain name in the list of domain names you want to work on [:eye_speech_bubble:](screenshots/SB-filter-en.png)
1. Click on the domain name to go to the detailed overview
1. On the detail page, locate the section "Authorisations codes" on the right side of the page [:eye_speech_bubble:](screenshots/SB-details-en.png)
1. Click "Change To Registrar Management" or "Change Registrar" to go to the page to generate the authorisation code
1. Click "GENERATE CODE" [:eye_speech_bubble:](screenshots/SB-transfer-generate-en.png)

A code is now generated, this code should be provided to the registrar to whom the registrant wants to transfer. [:eye_speech_bubble:](screenshots/SB-transfer-generated-en.png)

Once the code is in the possession of the registrar, it can be used to execute the actual operation of transferring the domain name.

The authorisation code works:

- Only for a single domain name
- Only for a single operation
- Has a lifespan of 14 days
- Can be replaced with a new code
- Can be deleted, meaning the authorisation is retracted

An authorization token can be generated/issued for transfer to another registrar, where the receiving registrar via the token has the authorization to perform the operation.

The authorization token has to be communicated out of band.

The token has the format: `<role>-<operation>-<unique token>`

An example: `REG-TRANSFER-098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6`

- The authorization is generated/issued by a registrar (`REG`, for registrar)
- The authorization is for a transfer operation (`TRANSFER`)
- and finally a unique key

Since an authorization could also be issue by the registrant, that example would resemble the following: `OWN-TRANSFER-098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6`

- The authorization is generated/issued by a registrant (`OWN`, for registrant/_owner_)
- The authorization is for a transfer operation (`TRANSFER`)
- and finally a unique key

### Change Name Servers as Registrant

1. Log in to the self-service portal [:eye_speech_bubble:](screenshots/SB-login-en.png)
1. Find the domain name in the list of domain names you want to work on [:eye_speech_bubble:](screenshots/SB-filter-en.png)
1. Click on the domain name to go to the detailed overview
1. On the detail page, locate the section "Manage domain name" on the right side of the page [:eye_speech_bubble:](screenshots/SB-details2-en.png)
1. Click "Change change name servers - external" or "Change change name servers - internal" to go to start the wizard to change the name servers
1. First step displays the existing name servers, enter the primary name server you want to change to and click "CONTINUE" [:eye_speech_bubble:](screenshots/SB-change_ns_external-en.png)
1. Second step displays the existing name servers and the newly located name servers, if the proposed change is acceptable click "CONTINUE" [:eye_speech_bubble:](screenshots/SB-change_ns_external-confirm-en.png)
1. Third step displays the confirmation of the operation and the new name servers [:eye_speech_bubble:](screenshots/SB-change_ns_external-confirmed-en.png)

For a name server change to be successful, the following pre-conditions has to be met:

- The name server must be registered with Punktum dk in advance, by a registrar or name server administrator
- The name server has to be active, it must not have pending operations or be marked for deletion
- The name server has to respond for the domain name, see also: ["Required Responsiveness"](https://github.com/Punktum-dk/dkhm-name-service-specification#required-responsiveness) in the [Punktum dk Name Service specification][DKHMNSSPEC]
- At least two name servers should respond, see also: ["Required Amount of Name Servers"](https://github.com/Punktum-dk/dkhm-name-service-specification#required-amount-of-name-servers) in the [Punktum dk Name Service specification][DKHMNSSPEC]
